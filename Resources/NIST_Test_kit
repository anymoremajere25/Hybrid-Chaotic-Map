## NIST Statistical Test Suite (STS)

To run the NIST randomness tests on the generated keystreams, follow these steps:

1. **Download the NIST STS package**

   Go to the official NIST page and download the test suite (`sts-2.1.2.zip`):

   https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/random-bit-generation/documentation-and-software

2. **Install and set up**

   - Extract the ZIP file.
   - Follow the instructions in the included documentation to compile and install the suite on your system
     (typically using `make` on Linux/Unix-based systems).

3. **Run the tests**

   Once installed, prepare your binary sequence file(s) as required by NIST STS and run the test driver
   (e.g. `./assess <sequence_length>`). Refer to the NIST documentation for details on:
   - input file format  
   - configuring which tests to run  
   - interpreting the resulting p-values and summary reports.
